Rheadoor
========

This project was inspired by a buddy who recently started raising chickens here in Chicago.

The Rheadoor is a combination of a webservice (and eventually a front end website) that is going
to control various functions of a chicken coop, starting with an electronic door opening/closing
system. The hardware is using a Raspberry Pi 4 with various controllers to interface with motors
that will control the door functions.

Current hardware manifest:
Sparkfun EasyDriver - header pins soldered
Stepper motor 17HS16-2004S

Requires Python 3.7 or greater and a Raspberry Pi 4 running latest Raspian OS.
